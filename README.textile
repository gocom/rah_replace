h1. rah_replace

p. A tiny "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com plugin that returns contained content with all searched occurrences replaced with given replacements. This ideally works in the same manner as PHP's "str_replace":http://php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php function, but with a Textpattern's XML tag.

h2. Basics

p. The plugin, rah_replace, introduces a new container tag to Textpattern's arsenal. The tag returns wrapped content with all found occurrences replaced with given replacements. A tag supports multiple searched occurrences and replacements.

bc. <txp:rah_replace from="value1, value2, ..." to="value1, value2, ...">
	Searched content
</txp:rah_replace>

h2. Attributes

p. The tag is a container, @<txp:rah_replace> ...contained statement... </txp:rah_replace>@, and attributes for it follow.

p. *from*
Strings that will be searched and replaced with @to@ attribute's values. Separate multiple values with a comma (or @delimiter@ if changed).
Default: @from=""@ Example: @"dog,cat,house"@

p. *to*
Replacements that will be used to replace @from@ attribute's values. Comma (or @delimiter@) separated if multiple.
Default: @to=""@ Example: @"ship,home,hat"@

p. *delimiter*
Sets the delimiter used in @from@ and @to@ to separate multiple values. Default is a comma.
Default: @delimiter=","@ Example: @"|"@

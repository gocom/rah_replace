h1. rah_replace

p. A tiny "Textpattern":http://www.textpattern.com plugin that returns contained content with all searched occurrences replaced with given replacements. This ideally works in the same way as PHP's "str_replace":http://php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php function, but with a Textpattern's XML tag.

h2. Basic concept

p. The plugin, rah_replace, comes with a tag which can be used as a container tag. The tag returns wrapped content with all found occurrences replaces with the given replacements. One tag supports multiple searches and replacements.

bc. <txp:rah_replace from="value1, value2, ..." to="value1, value2, ...">
	Searched content
</txp:rah_replace>

h2. Attributes

p. The tag is a container, @<txp:rah_replace>###</txp:rah_replace>@, and attributes for it follow.

p. *from*
String/thing or multiple strings that will be searched and replaced with @to@ attribute's values. Comma (or @delimiter@ value) separated if multiple.
Default: @from=""@ Example: @"dog,cat,house"@

p. *to*
Replacement or multiple replacements that will be used to replace @from@ attribute's occurrences. Comma (or @delimiter@ value) separated if multiple.
Default: @to=""@ Example: @"ship,home,hat"@

p. *delimiter*
Set the separator/delimiter that is used in @from@ and @to@ values to separate list of multiple values. Default is comma.
Default: @delimiter=","@ Example: @"|"@
